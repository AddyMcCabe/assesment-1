// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning 
// Analysis of Requirements 
// Design 
// Implementation 
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const implimentation = 'The real code is written in this step'
const testingAndIntegration = 'In this step, all the modules are brought together into a special testing environment, then checked for errors, bugs, and interoperability'
const maintain = 'During the maintenance stage of the SDLC, the system is assessed to ensure it does not become obsolete. this is also where changes are made to the initial software'
